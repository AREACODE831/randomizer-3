Destiny -
Do you remember what was the first conversation with your friend or teacher or lover who are with you now?

I often think that coincidences shape the destiny and destiny comes to our life with coincidences.

I will draw or collage the images like walking into the crowd and
random someone talk to you with random words.

The moment of coincidence- destiny.
