# randomizer -3 (2c.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
Before I create the image for the final version of randomizer,
I created a cat randomizer.
You can talk to a cat and they will answer to you!



Final one that I will try to do >>
Destiny -
Do you remember what was the first conversation with your friend or teacher or lover who are with you now?

I often think that coincidences shape the destiny and destiny comes to our life with coincidences.

I will draw or collage the images like walking into the crowd and
random someone talk to you with random words.

The moment of coincidence- destiny.
